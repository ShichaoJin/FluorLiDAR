# FluorLiDAR

## Step 1. PAR simulation from LiDAR points
The source code of this step can be acquired by contacting Prof. Guang Zheng as declaimed in previous publications (Ma et al., 2021).

## Setp2. Point-level SIF simulation from PAR simlutaion
This step includes two parts, one is the "_(1) SIF simulation at the leaf scale_" and the other is "_(2) Multiple scattering SIF simulation_".
The main source code is _SIF_daytime_Baima_distribution.m_.


## Step3 Directional SIF simulation
The main source code is _SIF_daytime_canopy_biDirectional_cylinder.m_.


Other scrpts are predefined variables or key functions used by the main source codes. 
_RZT_ms2.txt_ and _RT_ms3.txt_ are generated by the _4-scale model_.
